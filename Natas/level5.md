# Natas Level 5 -> 6

## Solution

For this one similar to the others I just simply inspected the website went over memory, network, console, etc. This level didn’t really have any kind of hints until I stumbled into the cookie being mentioned in the network tab. While I had a vague idea of how cookies work to track their users, etc., I didn’t really know what exactly they do, so after some googling, I realised that they sit in the Application section and I found that I could change the value on the cookies from 0 to 1 which would log me in and that gave me the password. Cookies are crazy insecure.
